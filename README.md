# gondi - NDI Library wrapper for golang

This is a wrapper for the [NDI SDK](https://www.newtek.com/ndi/sdk/), for Golang.

It works with Linux and OSX. Windows is not supported yet, as this implementation currently uses purego that does not support Windows.

## Installation

### Linux

Install the NDI SDK from [here](https://www.newtek.com/ndi/sdk/). Or download directly from https://downloads.ndi.tv/SDK/NDI_SDK_Linux/Install_NDI_SDK_v5_Linux.tar.gz

### OSX

Install the NDI SDK from [here](https://www.newtek.com/ndi/sdk/).
